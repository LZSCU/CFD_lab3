  1.<br>
	The wheel of the original car has been modified, and I have done some other suture.<br>
	figure of the new model -> prepare the vehicle geometry -> view.pdf<br>
  2.<br>
	The water tightness has been checked<br>
	Process: OK<br>
  3.<br>
	domain design <br>
	process: OK<br>
 	figure of the domain -> design the computational domain -> domain.pdf<br>
	figure of the process -> design the computational domain -> process fig.pdf<br>
  4.<br>
	The velocity of the free stream has been changed from 40m/s to 20m/s to fit the realastic case.<br>
 5.<br>
	a more detailed computational domain has been added.
	figure of the domain -> design the computational domain -> domain.pdf
	the first page is the 3D case, and the second page is the 2D breakdown.</font>

    1.<br>
    modify the domain<br>
    figure of the domain -> design the computational domain -> domain.pdf<br>
    delete process fig.pdf, because it is inapplicable for the new domain<br>
    2.<br>
conduct the grid convergence test<br>
	drag of the test -> grid convergence test -> force.svg<br>
    cd of the test -> grid convergence test -> cd.svg<br>
    cd_mean of the test -> grid convergence test -> cd_.svg<br>
  3.<br>
	Add more content for the report including the grid convergence test part<br>
  4.<br>
    code for lab3 -> code
