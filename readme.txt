  1.
	The wheel of the original car has been modified, and I have done some other suture. 
	figure of the new model -> prepare the vehicle geometry -> view.pdf

  2.
	The water tightness has been checked
	Process: OK
  3.
	domain design 
	process: OK
 	figure of the domain -> design the computational domain -> domain.pdf
	figure of the process -> design the computational domain -> process fig.pdf
  4.
	The velocity of the free stream has been changed from 40m/s to 20m/s to fit the realastic 	case.  
  5.
	a more detailed computational domain has been added.
	figure of the domain -> design the computational domain -> domain.pdf
	the first page is the 3D case, and the second page is the 2D breakdown.
